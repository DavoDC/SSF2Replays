# Davo's SSF2 Replays Repository

### General
My Super Smash Flash 2 (SSF2) replay files.
<br />This repo helps me synchronize my replays across multiple computers, back them up, share them publicly etc.

Here is [my YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4xPDj5h-MRmTaa8-xIBfaA/videos) where I upload recordings of some of these replays.

The oldest replay in this repo is from **11th January 2021**. 
<br /> This is around when replay autosave was introduced in [version 1.3.0.0](https://www.supersmashflash.com/2020/12/ssf2-v1-3-released/).
<br /> I started playing SSF2 much earlier (around 2014/2015) but unfortunately the replays from that time were not saved.

### Note about Replay Dates
Many dates on the replays are one day ahead due to a coding error within SSF2.
<br /> This error in SSF2 can be fixed by following the instructions in [this Reddit post](https://www.reddit.com/r/SuperSmashFlash/comments/t3z28b/fixing_the_replay_autosave_date_day_glitcherror).

### Note to Self
