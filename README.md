# Davo's SSF2 Replays Repository
My Super Smash Flash 2 (SSF2) replay files.
<br />This repo helps me synchronize my replays across multiple computers, back them up, share them publicly etc.

Here is my YouTube channel where I upload recordings of some of these replays:

**Note about replay dates:**
<br /> Many dates on the replays are one day ahead due to a coding error within SSF2.
<br /> This error in SSF2 can be fixed by following the instructions here:

**Note to self:**
<br /> `updateREADME.py` must be ran before making comments to ensure the line below is correct.
